SJW Replacement
===========

Do not let the white supremacists normalize their movement with a term like "alt-right". They are racists, and we cannot let them hide in plain sight. 

This is a simple, general purpose (although I have used it for my singular social justice purpose!), text replacer for chrome. Look at the code, it's pretty obvious - define an array of object literals at the top, each with a regex for `find` and an array of replacement strings in `replace`, and it will go throught the content and replace with a single selection from the list.

The code for finding and replacing text in the DOM is shamelessly copied from https://github.com/ericwbailey/millennials-to-snake-people
